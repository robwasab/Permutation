grid - Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid 

<h3><a name="M3">SYNOPSIS</a></h3>

<b>grid</b> <i>option arg</i> ?<i>arg ...</i>?<br>
<h3><a name="M4">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

The <b>grid</b> command is used to communicate with the grid
geometry manager that arranges widgets in rows and columns inside
of another window, called the geometry master (or master window).
The <b>grid</b> command can have any of several forms, depending on
the <i>option</i> argument: 

<dl class="description">
<dt><a name="M5"><b>grid</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>slave ...</i>?
?<i>options</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>If the first argument to <b>grid</b> is suitable as the first
slave argument to <b>grid configure</b>, either a window name (any
value starting with <b>.</b>) or one of the characters <b>x</b> or
<b>^</b> (see the <b>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</b> section below), then
the command is processed in the same way as <b>grid
configure</b>.</dd>

<dt><a name="M6"><b>grid anchor</b> <i>master</i>
?<i>anchor</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>The anchor value controls how to place the grid within the
master when no row/column has any weight. See <b>THE GRID
ALGORITHM</b> below for further details. The default <i>anchor</i>
is <i>nw</i>.</dd>

<dt><a name="M7"><b>grid bbox</b> <i>master</i> ?<i>column row</i>?
?<i>column2 row2</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>With no arguments, the bounding box (in pixels) of the grid is
returned. The return value consists of 4 integers. The first two
are the pixel offset from the master window (x then y) of the
top-left corner of the grid, and the second two integers are the
width and height of the grid, also in pixels. If a single
<i>column</i> and <i>row</i> is specified on the command line, then
the bounding box for that cell is returned, where the top left cell
is numbered from zero. If both <i>column</i> and <i>row</i>
arguments are specified, then the bounding box spanning the rows
and columns indicated is returned.</dd>

<dt><a name="M8"><b>grid columnconfigure</b> <i>master index</i>
?<i>-option value...</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>Query or set the column properties of the <i>index</i> column
of the geometry master, <i>master</i>. The valid options are
<b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.
If one or more options are provided, then <i>index</i> may be given
as a list of column indices to which the configuration options will
operate on. Indices may be integers, window names or the keyword
<i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the options apply to all columns
currently occupied be slave windows. For a window name, that window
must be a slave of this master and the options apply to all columns
currently occupied be the slave. The <b>-minsize</b> option sets
the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this
column. The <b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the
relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among columns. A
weight of zero (0) indicates the column will not deviate from its
requested size. A column whose weight is two will grow at twice the
rate as a column of weight one when extra space is allocated to the
layout. The <b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is
supplied, places the column in a <i>uniform group</i> with other
columns that have the same value for <b>-uniform</b>. The space for
columns belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their
sizes are always in strict proportion to their <b>-weight</b>
values. See <b>THE GRID ALGORITHM</b> below for further details.
The <b>-pad</b> option specifies the number of screen units that
will be added to the largest window contained completely in that
column when the grid geometry manager requests a size from the
containing window. If only an option is specified, with no value,
the current value of that option is returned. If only the master
window and index is specified, all the current settings are
returned in a list of &ldquo;-option value&rdquo; pairs.</dd>

<dt><a name="M9"><b>grid configure</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>slave
...</i>? ?<i>options</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>The arguments consist of the names of one or more slave windows
followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the
slaves. The characters <b>-</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be
specified instead of a window name to alter the default location of
a <i>slave</i>, as described in the <b>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</b>
section, below. The following options are supported: 

<dl class="description">
<dt><a name="M10"><b>-column</b> <i>n</i></a></dt>

<dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies the <i>n</i>th column in
the grid. Column numbers start with 0. If this option is not
supplied, then the slave is arranged just to the right of previous
slave specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or column
&ldquo;0&rdquo; if it is the first slave. For each <b>x</b> that
immediately precedes the <i>slave</i>, the column position is
incremented by one. Thus the <b>x</b> represents a blank column for
this row in the grid.</dd>

<dt><a name="M11"><b>-columnspan</b> <i>n</i></a></dt>

<dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies <i>n</i> columns in the
grid. The default is one column, unless the window name is followed
by a <b>-</b>, in which case the columnspan is incremented once for
each immediately following <b>-</b>.</dd>

<dt><a name="M12"><b>-in</b> <i>other</i></a></dt>

<dd>Insert the slave(s) in the master window given by <i>other</i>.
The default is the first slave's parent window.</dd>

<dt><a name="M13"><b>-ipadx</b> <i>amount</i></a></dt>

<dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much horizontal internal
padding to leave on each side of the slave(s). This is space is
added inside the slave(s) border. The <i>amount</i> must be a valid
screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>. It defaults to
0.</dd>

<dt><a name="M14"><b>-ipady</b> <i>amount</i></a></dt>

<dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much vertical internal padding
to leave on the top and bottom of the slave(s). This space is added
inside the slave(s) border. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0.</dd>

<dt><a name="M15"><b>-padx</b> <i>amount</i></a></dt>

<dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much horizontal external
padding to leave on each side of the slave(s), in screen units.
<i>Amount</i> may be a list of two values to specify padding for
left and right separately. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This
space is added outside the slave(s) border.</dd>

<dt><a name="M16"><b>-pady</b> <i>amount</i></a></dt>

<dd>The <i>amount</i> specifies how much vertical external padding
to leave on the top and bottom of the slave(s), in screen units.
<i>Amount</i> may be a list of two values to specify padding for
top and bottom separately. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This
space is added outside the slave(s) border.</dd>

<dt><a name="M17"><b>-row</b> <i>n</i></a></dt>

<dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies the <i>n</i>th row in the
grid. Row numbers start with 0. If this option is not supplied,
then the slave is arranged on the same row as the previous slave
specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or the first unoccupied row
if this is the first slave.</dd>

<dt><a name="M18"><b>-rowspan</b> <i>n</i></a></dt>

<dd>Insert the slave so that it occupies <i>n</i> rows in the grid.
The default is one row. If the next <b>grid</b> command contains
<b>^</b> characters instead of <i>slaves</i> that line up with the
columns of this <i>slave</i>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this
<i>slave</i> is extended by one.</dd>

<dt><a name="M19"><b>-sticky</b> <i>style</i></a></dt>

<dd>If a slave's cell is larger than its requested dimensions, this
option may be used to position (or stretch) the slave within its
cell. <i>Style</i> is a string that contains zero or more of the
characters <b>n</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>. The string can
optionally contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west) that the
slave will &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to. If both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b>
(or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are specified, the slave will be
stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its cavity. The
<b>sticky</b> option subsumes the combination of <b>-anchor</b> and
<b>-fill</b> that is used by <b><a href=
"../TkCmd/pack.htm">pack</a></b>. The default is &ldquo;&rdquo;,
which causes the slave to be centered in its cavity, at its
requested size.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If any of the slaves are already managed by the geometry manager
then any unspecified options for them retain their previous values
rather than receiving default values.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="M20"><b>grid forget</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>slave
...</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>Removes each of the <i>slave</i>s from grid for its master and
unmaps their windows. The slaves will no longer be managed by the
grid geometry manager. The configuration options for that window
are forgotten, so that if the slave is managed once more by the
grid geometry manager, the initial default settings are used.</dd>

<dt><a name="M21"><b>grid info</b> <i>slave</i></a></dt>

<dd>Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration
state of the slave given by <i>slave</i> in the same option-value
form that might be specified to <b>grid configure</b>. The first
two elements of the list are &ldquo;<b>-in</b> <i>master</i>&rdquo;
where <i>master</i> is the slave's master.</dd>

<dt><a name="M22"><b>grid location</b> <i>master x y</i></a></dt>

<dd>Given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values in screen units relative to
the master window, the column and row number at that <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> location is returned. For locations that are above or to
the left of the grid, <b>-1</b> is returned.</dd>

<dt><a name="M23"><b>grid propagate</b> <i>master</i>
?<i>boolean</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>If <i>boolean</i> has a true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or
<b>on</b> then propagation is enabled for <i>master</i>, which must
be a window name (see <b>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</b> below). If
<i>boolean</i> has a false boolean value then propagation is
disabled for <i>master</i>. In either of these cases an empty
string is returned. If <i>boolean</i> is omitted then the command
returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether propagation is
currently enabled for <i>master</i>. Propagation is enabled by
default.</dd>

<dt><a name="M24"><b>grid rowconfigure</b> <i>master index</i>
?<i>-option value...</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>Query or set the row properties of the <i>index</i> row of the
geometry master, <i>master</i>. The valid options are
<b>-minsize</b>, <b>-weight</b>, <b>-uniform</b> and <b>-pad</b>.
If one or more options are provided, then <i>index</i> may be given
as a list of row indices to which the configuration options will
operate on. Indices may be integers, window names or the keyword
<i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the options apply to all rows currently
occupied be slave windows. For a window name, that window must be a
slave of this master and the options apply to all rows currently
occupied be the slave. The <b>-minsize</b> option sets the minimum
size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this row. The
<b>-weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the relative weight
for apportioning any extra spaces among rows. A weight of zero (0)
indicates the row will not deviate from its requested size. A row
whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a row of weight
one when extra space is allocated to the layout. The
<b>-uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is supplied, places
the row in a <i>uniform group</i> with other rows that have the
same value for <b>-uniform</b>. The space for rows belonging to a
uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in strict
proportion to their <b>-weight</b> values. See <b>THE GRID
ALGORITHM</b> below for further details. The <b>-pad</b> option
specifies the number of screen units that will be added to the
largest window contained completely in that row when the grid
geometry manager requests a size from the containing window. If
only an option is specified, with no value, the current value of
that option is returned. If only the master window and index is
specified, all the current settings are returned in a list of
&ldquo;-option value&rdquo; pairs.</dd>

<dt><a name="M25"><b>grid remove</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>slave
...</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>Removes each of the <i>slave</i>s from grid for its master and
unmaps their windows. The slaves will no longer be managed by the
grid geometry manager. However, the configuration options for that
window are remembered, so that if the slave is managed once more by
the grid geometry manager, the previous values are retained.</dd>

<dt><a name="M26"><b>grid size</b> <i>master</i></a></dt>

<dd>Returns the size of the grid (in columns then rows) for
<i>master</i>. The size is determined either by the <i>slave</i>
occupying the largest row or column, or the largest column or row
with a <b>minsize</b>, <b>weight</b>, or <b>pad</b> that is
non-zero.</dd>

<dt><a name="M27"><b>grid slaves</b> <i>master</i> ?<i>-option
value</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>If no options are supplied, a list of all of the slaves in
<i>master</i> are returned, most recently manages first.
<i>Option</i> can be either <b>-row</b> or <b>-column</b> which
causes only the slaves in the row (or column) specified by
<i>value</i> to be returned.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="M28">RELATIVE PLACEMENT</a></h3>

The <b>grid</b> command contains a limited set of capabilities that
permit layouts to be created without specifying the row and column
information for each slave. This permits slaves to be rearranged,
added, or removed without the need to explicitly specify row and
column information. When no column or row information is specified
for a <i>slave</i>, default values are chosen for <b>column</b>,
<b>row</b>, <b>columnspan</b> and <b>rowspan</b> at the time the
<i>slave</i> is managed. The values are chosen based upon the
current layout of the grid, the position of the <i>slave</i>
relative to other <i>slave</i>s in the same grid command, and the
presence of the characters <b>-</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>^</b> in
<b>grid</b> command where <i>slave</i> names are normally expected.


<dl class="relative placement">
<dt><a name="M29"><b>-</b></a></dt>

<dd>This increases the columnspan of the <i>slave</i> to the left.
Several <b>-</b>'s in a row will successively increase the
columnspan. A <b>-</b> may not follow a <b>^</b> or a <b>x</b>, nor
may it be the first <i>slave</i> argument to <b>grid
configure</b>.</dd>

<dt><a name="M30"><b>x</b></a></dt>

<dd>This leaves an empty column between the <i>slave</i> on the
left and the <i>slave</i> on the right.</dd>

<dt><a name="M31"><b>^</b></a></dt>

<dd>This extends the <b>rowspan</b> of the <i>slave</i> above the
<b>^</b>'s in the grid. The number of <b>^</b>'s in a row must
match the number of columns spanned by the <i>slave</i> above
it.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="M32">THE GRID ALGORITHM</a></h3>

The grid geometry manager lays out its slaves in three steps. In
the first step, the minimum size needed to fit all of the slaves is
computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of
the master window to become that size. In the second step, the
requested size is compared against the actual size of the master.
If the sizes are different, then spaces is added to or taken away
from the layout as needed. For the final step, each slave is
positioned in its row(s) and column(s) based on the setting of its
<i>sticky</i> flag. 

<p>To compute the minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry
manager first looks at all slaves whose columnspan and rowspan
values are one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column
to be either the <i>minsize</i> for that row or column, or the sum
of the <i>pad</i>ding plus the size of the largest slave, whichever
is greater. After that the rows or columns in each uniform group
adapt to each other. Then the slaves whose rowspans or columnspans
are greater than one are examined. If a group of rows or columns
need to be increased in size in order to accommodate these slaves,
then extra space is added to each row or column in the group
according to its <i>weight</i>. For each group whose weights are
all zero, the additional space is apportioned equally.</p>

<p>When multiple rows or columns belong to a uniform group, the
space allocated to them is always in proportion to their weights.
(A weight of zero is considered to be 1.) In other words, a row or
column configured with <b>-weight 1 -uniform a</b> will have
exactly the same size as any other row or column configured with
<b>-weight 1 -uniform a</b>. A row or column configured with
<b>-weight 2 -uniform b</b> will be exactly twice as large as one
that is configured with <b>-weight 1 -uniform b</b>.</p>

<p>More technically, each row or column in the group will have a
size equal to <i>k*weight</i> for some constant <i>k</i>. The
constant <i>k</i> is chosen so that no row or column becomes
smaller than its minimum size. For example, if all rows or columns
in a group have the same weight, then each row or column will have
the same size as the largest row or column in the group.</p>

<p>For masters whose size is larger than the requested layout, the
additional space is apportioned according to the row and column
weights. If all of the weights are zero, the layout is placed
within its master according to the <i>anchor</i> value. For masters
whose size is smaller than the requested layout, space is taken
away from columns and rows according to their weights. However,
once a column or row shrinks to its minsize, its weight is taken to
be zero. If more space needs to be removed from a layout than would
be permitted, as when all the rows or columns are at their minimum
sizes, the layout is placed and clipped according to the
<i>anchor</i> value.</p>

<h3><a name="M33">GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</a></h3>

The grid geometry manager normally computes how large a master must
be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves, and it sets the
requested width and height of the master to these dimensions. This
causes geometry information to propagate up through a window
hierarchy to a top-level window so that the entire sub-tree sizes
itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows. However, the <b>grid
propagate</b> command may be used to turn off propagation for one
or more masters. If propagation is disabled then grid will not set
the requested width and height of the master window. This may be
useful if, for example, you wish for a master window to have a
fixed size that you specify. 

<h3><a name="M34">RESTRICTIONS ON MASTER WINDOWS</a></h3>

The master for each slave must either be the slave's parent (the
default) or a descendant of the slave's parent. This restriction is
necessary to guarantee that the slave can be placed over any part
of its master that is visible without danger of the slave being
clipped by its parent. In addition, all slaves in one call to
<b>grid</b> must have the same master. 

<h3><a name="M35">STACKING ORDER</a></h3>

If the master for a slave is not its parent then you must make sure
that the slave is higher in the stacking order than the master.
Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will appear as
if the slave has not been managed correctly. The easiest way to
make sure the slave is higher than the master is to create the
master window first: the most recently created window will be
highest in the stacking order. 

<h3><a name="M36">CREDITS</a></h3>

The <b>grid</b> command is based on ideas taken from the
<i>GridBag</i> geometry manager written by Doug. Stein, and the
<b>blt_table</b> geometry manager, written by George Howlett. 

<h3><a name="M37">EXAMPLES</a></h3>

A toplevel window containing a text widget and two scrollbars: 

<pre>
# Make the widgets
toplevel .t
text .t.txt -wrap none -xscroll {.t.h set} -yscroll {.t.v set}
scrollbar .t.v -orient vertical   -command {.t.txt yview}
scrollbar .t.h -orient horizontal -command {.t.txt xview}

# Lay them out
<b>grid</b> .t.txt .t.v -sticky nsew
<b>grid</b> .t.h        -sticky nsew

# Tell the text widget to take all the extra room
<b>grid rowconfigure</b>    .t .t.txt -weight 1
<b>grid columnconfigure</b> .t .t.txt -weight 1
</pre>

<p>Three widgets of equal width, despite their different
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; widths:</p>

<pre>

entry .e -variable foo
label .l -text "This is a fairly long piece of text"

<b>grid</b> .b .e .l -sticky ew
