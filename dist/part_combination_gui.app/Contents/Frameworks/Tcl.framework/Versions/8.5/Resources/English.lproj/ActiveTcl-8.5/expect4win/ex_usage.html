<h2><a name="overview">Expect for Windows Overview</a></h2>

<p>ActiveState Expect for Windows provides the ability to automate
interactive programs from within the Windows environment. For
example, use Expect for Windows to telnet to a Unix client and run
commands on the remote system. By driving the telnet session with
Expect for Windows, you have the ability to fully automate the
process.</p>

<p>ActiveState Expect for Windows includes the following
features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automation of interactive programs from the Windows
platform.</li>

<li>Compatibility with the latest Tcl core (Tcl 8.4+).</li>

<li>Stubs-enabled and deployable using <a target="_blank" href=
"http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/Tcl_Dev_Kit/TclApp.html">TclApp</a>,
a component in the ActiveState Tcl Dev Kit.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="about_doc">About this Document</a></h3>

<p>This document discusses how to use Expect for Windows to
automate various programs. This document is divided into three
parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first part describes three Expect for Windows use
cases.</li>

<li>The second part addresses how the Expect for Windows port
differs from Expect, including command and behavior modifications.
Tips for writing cross-platform scripts are also outlined.</li>

<li>The third part describes the process of wrapping Expect for
Windows scripts in TclApp, a component of the Tcl Dev Kit.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document should be used together with the <a href=
"expect.html">Expect for Windows Reference</a>, which lists all
available Expect commands and options.</p>

<h2><a name="code_tcl">Writing Expect Scripts</a></h2>

<p>This section discusses how to write Tcl scripts to use Expect
for Windows. The first part addresses <a href="#tcl_usage">using
Expect with Tcl</a>. Next, three use cases are provided to
demonstrate how Expect for Windows can be used to automate the
interaction between various remote Unix programs. Each use case
includes code snippets to demonstrate the communication between
Expect for Windows and the interacting Unix program. It should be
noted that this sample code is incomplete and does not provide the
adequate error checking recommended for successful automation.</p>

<h3><a name="tcl_usage">Using Expect with Tcl</a></h3>

<p>Expect for Windows is implemented as a Tcl package (as opposed
to a stand-alone executable). Expect for Windows must be declared
in a Tcl script with the <code>package require Expect</code>
statement. For example:</p>

<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    # \
    exec tclsh "$0" ${1+"$@"}
    package require Expect
</pre>

<p>Failure to declare the <code>package require Expect</code>
statement results in an error message when running the script on
the Windows platform.</p>

<h3><a name="ftp">Use Case 1: FTP</a></h3>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
Use Expect for Windows to automatically upload a completed software
build from a Windows machine to a Unix FTP server.</p>

<h3><a name="login">Use Case 3: Remote Directory Lister

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
Use Expect for Windows to automatically login to a remote Unix
server from a Windows machine. Use the "ls" program to remotely
list the contents of a directory. The Remote Directory Lister
Tutorial demonstrates how to write a complete Tcl script using
Expect for Windows. See the <a href="ex_tut.html">Remote Directory

<h2><a name="cross_platform">Porting Expect Scripts to
Windows</a></h2>

<p>The ActiveState Expect for Windows implementation differs from
the original Expect written by Don Libes (at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)). These differences are due to
Expect initially being written for the Unix platform. This section
addresses the various command and behavior modifications in the
Windows port. The last part lists the <a href=
"#caveats">caveats</a> you should consider when writing Expect
scripts.</p>

<h3><a name="e4w_commands">Expect for Windows Commands</a></h3>

<p>To review all available commands and options, see the <a href=
"expect.html">Expect for Windows Reference</a> for more
information.</p>

<h3><a name="e4w_modified">Modified Commands and Behaviors</a></h3>

<p>The following Expect commands and behaviors are modified for
Windows usage:</p>

<p>Modified Commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>exp_close</strong>: The <code>-slave</code> option is
not supported.</li>

<li><strong>exp_send_*</strong>: The <code>-break</code> flag is
not supported. Does not implement a parser for VT100 codes for
special keypress codes such as "arrow up", F1, Home, etc.</li>

<li><strong>exp_spawn</strong>: The <code>-ignore</code> and
<code>-trap</code> options are not supported.</li>

<li><strong>exp_spawn</strong>: Supports two new options:<br>
 

<ul>
<li><code>-environment</code>: Takes a list of name/value pairs in
the form that <code>array get</code> would return.</li>

<li><code>-directory</code>: Sets the starting directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>exp_stty</strong>: Redirection is not supported. Row
and column options are not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modified Behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li>TTY channels are not created when not already provided to the
application. This is not applicable on Unix. (For example, if
<code>CreateFile("CONOUT$")</code> fails when asking for an
existing TTY channel, there is no recourse in the generic layer to
create one.) Only a single console window is allowed per process on
Windows. This affects <code>exp_send_tty</code> and
<code>expect_tty</code>, and is a prerequisite for enabling
<code>exp_interact</code>.</li>

<li>Signal manipulation beyond the seven signals abstracted via
ANSI's <code>signal.h</code> is not supported, nor are
windows-specific ones such as <code>CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT</code>.
Also, <code>exp_wait</code> is limited in the same way for signal
exits, as is the core's <code>Tcl_WaitPid()</code> which it
uses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following commands are not applicable to the Windows
platform. When used, these commands only return errors.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>exp_fork</strong>: Not applicable on Windows.</li>

<li><strong>exp_overlay</strong>: Not applicable on Windows.</li>

<li><strong>exp_disconnect</strong>: Not applicable on
Windows.</li>

<li><strong>exp_system</strong>: Use <code>exec</code> instead
.</li>

<li><strong>exp_open</strong>: Detaching to Tcl is not
enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="e4w_unimplemented">Unimplemented Commands and
Behaviors</a></h3>

<p>This section addresses those commands and behaviors that have
yet to be implemented in Expect for Windows:</p>

<p>Unimplemented Commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>exp_interact</strong>: Usage creates a syntax error.
Command is not implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unimplemented Behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expect clib</strong>: The C Library is not
implemented.</li>

<li><strong>Expect channels</strong>: Cannot be moved to a
different thread with <code>thread::transfer</code>. This is a
limitation of Tcl's channel API.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="caveats">Caveats</a></h3>

<p>The following caveats should be reviewed before writing Expect
for Windows scripts.</p>

<strong>Extensions</strong><br>
<p>Extensions may collide with Expect command names. For example,
<code>send</code> is defined by Tk for an entirely different
purpose. This is why the commands listed have the
"<code>exp_</code>" prefix. Use these extended command names to
ensure compatibility between Windows and Unix environments.</p>

<strong>Scope</strong><br>
<p>Expect takes a liberal view of scoping. In particular, variables
read by commands specific to the Expect program are sought first
from the local scope, and if not found, in the global scope. For
example, this obviates the need to place <code>global
timeout</code> in every procedure that uses
<strong>expect</strong>. On the other hand, variables written are
always in the local scope (unless a "global" command has been
issued). The most common problem this causes is when
<code>exp_spawn</code> is executed in a procedure. Outside the
procedure, <code>spawn_id</code> no longer exists, so the spawned
process is no longer accessible simply because of scoping. Add a
<code>global spawn_id</code> to such a procedure.</p>

<strong>Terminal Parameters</strong><br>
<p>Terminal parameters can have a big effect on scripts. For
example, if a script is written to look for echoing, it misbehaves
if echoing is turned off. For this reason, Expect forces terminal
parameters by default. Unfortunately, this can make things
challenging for other programs. For example, the emacs shell wants
to change the "usual" mappings: newlines get mapped to newlines
instead of carriage-return newlines, and echoing is disabled. A
user can use emacs to edit the input line. Unfortunately, Expect
cannot possibly guess this. You can tell Expect not to override its
default terminal parameters, but you must then be very careful when
writing scripts for such environments. In the case of emacs, avoid
depending upon things like echoing and end-of-line mappings.</p>

<strong>Single and Multiple Arguments</strong><br>
<p>Commands that accept arguments braced into a single list (the
<code>expect</code> variants<!-- and <code>interact</code>-->) use
a heuristic to decide if the list is actually one argument or many.
The heuristic can fail only in the case when the list actually does
represent a single argument which has multiple embedded
<code>\n</code>'s with non-whitespace characters between them. This
may seem unlikely, however, the argument <code>-nobrace</code> can
be used to force a single argument to be handled as a single
argument. This could conceivably be used with machine-generated
Expect code. Similarly, <code>-brace</code> forces a single
argument to be handled as multiple patterns or actions.</p>

<h3><a name="tips">Tips for Writing Expect Scripts</a></h3>

<p>This section addresses various tips for writing Expect
scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Use a shell command trick in your
scripts to associate the file type on Unix systems.</p>

<p>Place the following commands at the beginning of your Expect for
Windows scripts to run them in both Unix and Windows.</p>

<pre>
      #!/bin/sh
      # \
      exec tclsh "$0"  ${1+"$@"}
</pre>

<strong>Description:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>In Unix, these instructions identify the file as a Tcl script.
The <code>exec tclsh "$0" ${1+"$@"}</code> command launches the
tclsh interpreter to run the Expect for Windows script in
Unix.</li>

<li>In Windows, these instructions are viewed as commented code and
are ignored. Specifying an interpreter is unnecessary in Windows as
the ".tcl" file extension identifies the file as a Tcl script
(assuming that the PATH contains the Tcl interpreter).</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Debug the process by viewing the
controlled console.</p>

<p>Place the following variable near the beginning of your Expect
for Windows scripts to view program interaction on the Windows
platform.</p>

<pre>
      <span class=
"doccodecomment"># This special variable used by the ActiveState Expect for Windows</span>
      <span class=
"doccodecomment"># port will enable actual viewing of the controlled console.</span>
      <span class=
"doccodecomment"># Otherwise it remains hidden (default).</span>
      set exp::winnt_debug 1
</pre>

<strong>Description:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>The <code>set exp::winnt_debug 1</code> variable opens the
controlled console and displays the interaction between the Expect
for Windows script and the Unix program.</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Use a <a target="_blank" href=
"regex.html">regular expression</a> to recognize shell prompts.</p>

<p>A common Expect usage challenge is determining which shell
prompt to expect on the interacting Unix system. Since command
prompts vary greatly among users and shells, automating Expect to
interact with a program like <code>rlogin</code> can prove
difficult.</p>

<p>One solution is to use a <a target="_blank" href=
"regex.html">regular expression</a> to match a variety of prompt
types. Another solution is to use <code>catch</code> to see whether
a particular user stored a regular expression describing their
prompt in the <code>EXPECT_PROMPT</code> environment variable.</p>

<pre>
      set prompt "(%|#|\\$) $"    ;# default prompt
      catch {set prompt $env(EXPECT_PROMPT)}

      expect -re $prompt
</pre>

<strong>Description:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Use a <a target="_blank" href="regex.html">regular
expression</a> to match a prompt, for example <code>set prompt
"(%|#|\\$) $"</code></li>

<li>Attempt to catch the user's EXPECT_PROMPT environment
variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>To learn more about regular expression syntax and usage, see the
<a target="_blank" href="regex.html">Regular Expressions Primer</a>
for more information.</p>

<br>
 

<p><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Matching output</p>

<p><em>About Output:</em><br>
If you use a pattern of the form X*, the * matches all output
received from the end of X to the last character received. This
sounds intuitive but can be confusing because the phrase "last
character received" can vary depending upon the speed of the
computer and the processing of I/O, both by the kernel and the
device driver.</p>

<p>In particular, humans tend to see program output arriving in
large portions (atomically) when in reality most programs produce
output one line at a time. Assuming this is the case, the *, in X*,
may only match the end of the current line even though there seems
to be more. This is because at the time of the match this included
all received output. Expect does not know that further output is
arriving unless your pattern specifically accounts for it.</p>

<p><em>Express the last few characters of a prompt:</em><br>
Always express the last few characters of a prompt when writing
patterns as depending on line-oriented buffering is unwise.
Programs rarely reveal the type of buffering they do and system
indigestion can break-up output lines at seemingly random
places.</p>

<p><em>Use "timeout" and "eof" to determine last output:</em><br>
If you are waiting for a pattern in the last output of a program
and the program emits something else instead, you cannot detect it
with the <code>timeout</code> keyword. The reason is that
<code>expect</code> does not timeout. Rather, expect gets an
<code>eof</code> indication. Use the <code>eof</code> indication
along with the <code>timeout</code> keyword to be sure to located
the true last output.</p>

<p><em>Matching a two-lined pattern:</em><br>
Newlines are usually converted to carriage returns and linefeed
sequences when output by the terminal driver. When matching a
two-lined pattern as follows:</p>

<pre>
      printf("foo\nbar")
</pre>

<p>You may require a pattern constructed as follows:</p>

<pre>
      "foo\r\nbar"
</pre>

<br>
 

<p><strong>Tip 5:</strong> Matching user input</p>

<p>A similar translation occurs when reading from the user, via
<code>expect_user</code>. In this case, when you press "Return",
the character is translated to a newline. If <code>expect</code>
then passes that character to a program which sets its terminal to
raw mode (like telnet), a problem results, as the program expects a
true return. (Note that some programs are forgiving as they
automatically translate newlines to returns, but most do not.)
Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if a program puts its
terminal into raw mode.</p>

<p>Rather than manually replacing newlines with returns, the
solution is to use the command <code>stty raw</code>, which stops
the translation. Note that you can not get the cooked line-editing
features when <code>stty raw</code> is used.</p>

<h2><a name="wrapping_expect_tclapp">Wrapping Expect using
TclApp</a></h2>

<p>Use the Tcl Dev Kit's TclApp to seamlessly deploy your Expect
for Windows programs on any platform without installing Tcl or
otherwise configuring the system. The TclApp tool simplifies the
process of distributing an Expect for Windows application by
collecting all of the files needed to run a Tcl application -- such
as Tcl scripts, Expect libraries, graphics and other data files,
Tcl extensions, a Tcl interpreter, and the standard Tcl and Tk
libraries -- into a single executable file. A user can then install
the Expect for Windows file anywhere on their system and execute it
without installing any other packages or reconfiguring their
system.</p>

<p>To wrap Expect for Windows applications in TclApp, include the
Expect base kit (located under <code>Tcl/bin/</code>). Use the
Expect Tk base kit if you require the Tk package in your
application.</p>

<ul>
<li>base-expect-win32-ix86.exe</li>

<li>base-expect-tk-win32-ix86.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>You can include an Expect base kit in TclApp via the command
line or through the TclApp user interface. The Expect base kit
includes the dll <code>injector.dll</code> which will be
automatically extracted at runtime to the currently working
directory of the wrapped base kit for the controlling of spawned
applications. If this is not able to be extracted (e.g. on a
read-only file system), and the <code>injector.dll</code> does not
already exist on the system dll path, spawning will fail.</p>

<p><strong>Command Line:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Assign the base kit to a project using the
<code>-executable</code> flag on the command line, for
example:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
      tclapp.tcl -nologogui -executable {C:\Tcl\bin\base-expect-tk-win32-ix86.exe}
        -out {C:\Tcl\tkremotels.exe} -pkg BWidget -relativeto C:\Tcl\demos\Expect
        C:\Tcl\demos\Expect\tkremotels.tcl
</pre>

<p><strong>TclApp GUI Interface:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Assign the base kit to a project using the <strong>Prefix
file</strong> field on the Wrapping tab.</li>
</ul>
