<h3><a name="M2">NAME</a></h3>

grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window sub-tree 

<h3><a name="M3">SYNOPSIS</a></h3>

<b>grab</b> ?<b>-global</b>? <i>window</i><br>
<b>grab</b> <i>option</i> ?<i>arg arg</i> ...?<br>
<h3><a name="M4">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

This command implements simple pointer and keyboard grabs for Tk.
Tk's grabs are different than the grabs described in the Xlib
documentation. When a grab is set for a particular window, Tk
restricts all pointer events to the grab window and its descendants
in Tk's window hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is within the grab
window's subtree, the pointer will behave exactly the same as if
there had been no grab at all and all events will be reported in
the normal fashion. When the pointer is outside <i>window</i>'s
tree, button presses and releases and mouse motion events are
reported to <i>window</i>, and window entry and window exit events
are ignored. The grab subtree &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the pointer:
windows outside the grab subtree will be visible on the screen but
they will be insensitive until the grab is released. The tree of
windows underneath the grab window can include top-level windows,
in which case all of those top-level windows and their descendants
will continue to receive mouse events during the grab. 

<p>Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab
affects only the grabbing application: events will be reported to
other applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs are
local by default. A global grab locks out all applications on the
screen, so that only the given subtree of the grabbing application
will be sensitive to pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse
button releases, pointer motions, window entries, and window
exits). During global grabs the window manager will not receive
pointer events either.</p>

<p>During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key
releases) are delivered as usual: the window manager controls which
application receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any
window in the grabbing application then they are redirected to the
focus window. During a global grab Tk grabs the keyboard so that
all keyboard events are always sent to the grabbing application.
The <b><a href="../TkCmd/focus.htm">focus</a></b> command is still
used to determine which window in the application receives the
keyboard events. The keyboard grab is released when the grab is
released.</p>

<p>Grabs apply to particular displays. If an application has
windows on multiple displays then it can establish a separate grab
on each display. The grab on a particular display affects only the
windows on that display. It is possible for different applications
on a single display to have simultaneous local grabs, but only one
application can have a global grab on a given display at once.</p>

<p>The <b>grab</b> command can take any of the following forms:</p>

<dl class="description">
<dt><a name="M5"><b>grab</b> ?<b>-global</b>?
<i>window</i></a></dt>

<dd>Same as <b>grab set</b>, described below.</dd>

<dt><a name="M6"><b>grab current</b> ?<i>window</i>?</a></dt>

<dd>If <i>window</i> is specified, returns the name of the current
grab window in this application for <i>window</i>'s display, or an
empty string if there is no such window. If <i>window</i> is
omitted, the command returns a list whose elements are all of the
windows grabbed by this application for all displays, or an empty
string if the application has no grabs.</dd>

<dt><a name="M7"><b>grab release</b> <i>window</i></a></dt>

<dd>Releases the grab on <i>window</i> if there is one, otherwise
does nothing. Returns an empty string.</dd>

<dt><a name="M8"><b>grab set</b> ?<b>-global</b>?
<i>window</i></a></dt>

<dd>Sets a grab on <i>window</i>. If <b>-global</b> is specified
then the grab is global, otherwise it is local. If a grab was
already in effect for this application on <i>window</i>'s display
then it is automatically released. If there is already a grab on
<i>window</i> and it has the same global/local form as the
requested grab, then the command does nothing. Returns an empty
string.</dd>

<dt><a name="M9"><b>grab status</b> <i>window</i></a></dt>

<dd>Returns <b>none</b> if no grab is currently set on
<i>window</i>, <b>local</b> if a local grab is set on
<i>window</i>, and <b><a href="../TclCmd/global.htm">global</a></b>
if a global grab is set.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="M10">WARNING</a></h3>

It is very easy to use global grabs to render a display completely
unusable (e.g. by setting a grab on a widget which does not respond
to events and not providing any mechanism for releasing the grab).
Take <i>extreme</i> care when using them! 

<h3><a name="M11">BUGS</a></h3>

It took an incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce
the simple grab effect described above. Given the current
implementation, it is not safe for applications to use the Xlib
grab facilities at all except through the Tk grab procedures. If
applications try to manipulate X's grab mechanisms directly, things
will probably break. 

<p>If a single process is managing several different Tk
applications, only one of those applications can have a local grab
for a given display at any given time. If the applications are in
different processes, this restriction does not exist.</p>

<h3><a name="M12">EXAMPLE</a></h3>

Set a grab so that only one button may be clicked out of a group.
The other buttons are unresponsive to the mouse until the middle
button is clicked. 

<pre>
pack [button .b1 -text "Click me! #1" -command {destroy .b1}]
pack [button .b2 -text "Click me! #2" -command {destroy .b2}]
pack [button .b3 -text "Click me! #3" -command {destroy .b3}]
<b>grab</b> .b2
</pre>
