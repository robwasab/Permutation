<h2><a name="section1">Description</a></h2>

<p>The TEApot system is ActiveState's initial implementation of Tcl
package repository management.</p>

<p>At the center of the system we have three main concepts which
interact with each other:</p>

<ol class="enumerated">
<li>
<p>Entities</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Meta data</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Repositories</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The relationship between these three is simple:</p>

<ul class="itemized">
<li>
<p>Repositories -&gt; contain Entities -&gt; contain Meta data
-&gt; describe Entities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An entity contains meta data which describes the entity, whether
the entity is a package, an application, or a profile. For the rest
of this introductory document I will focus primarily on examples
relating to package entities, i.e. packages, mentioning other
entities only where necessary.</p>

<p>We limit what can be stored in a repository. I.e. the TEApot
system is not able to handle any possible form a Tcl package may
take (such as, for example, a directory containing multiple
packages sharing a single "<b class="file">pkgIndex.tcl</b>" file).
The handful of formats it can process however are enough as all
other formats can be converted to at least one of them. Just as
with Tcl Modules, as described in <a href=
"http://tip.tcl.tk/189">TIP 189</a> we give up on the extreme set
of choices available to Tcl developers, making things easier, yet
without truly limiting the system in what it can do.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2><a name="section2">Entities and Storage Formats</a></h2>

<div id="subsection1" class="subsection">
<h3><a name="subsection1">Entities</a></h3>

<p>TEApot currently handling three types of entities:</p>

<dl class="definitions">
<dt><i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key26">Package</a></i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Packages are Tcl packages, except that their executable
component is not standing alone anymore, but has meta data
associated with it.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key27">Application</a></i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Applications are Tcl based applications, except that their
executable component is not standing alone anymore, but has meta
data associated with it.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key18">Profile</a></i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Profiles are named collections of entities. As an example of
profiles, ActiveState has defined a Tcllib profile (which describes
all of the Tcllib modules) and, for that matter, all of
ActiveTcl.</p>

<p>They are special insofar as the provided repository server (<b
class="syscmd"><a href="CTP_teapot.html">teapot</a></b>) recognizes
them and tags them as such in the package listings it generates in
response to search and list requests. The standard client (<b
class="syscmd"><a href="CTP_teacup.html">teacup</a></b>) recognizes
them as well. There the special treatment is that the client will
follow and install the referenced entitites, but not the profile
itself.</p>

<p>While profiles are treated specially by the various applications
of the teapot system at the technical level they are not special at
all. They can come in any of the forms listed above, with the
proviso that anything beyond their meta data will be ignored. As
only their dependencies matter, and as they are not installed,
their functionality is irrelevant, and can be left out
completely.</p>

<p>While it is possible to package a profile as a zip archive
(containing only meta data) we do expect that the majority of
profiles will be packaged as Tcl Modules. This is also the format
used when the client is instructed to generate a profile for a list
of packages. See the next section for details about these storage
formats.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div id="subsection2" class="subsection">
<h3><a name="subsection2">Storage Formats</a></h3>

<p>TEApot accepts entities which are in one of the four formats
below and understands how the meta data describing them is embedded
into them. The details of the latter are specified in the <i class=
"term"><a href="CTP_metadata.html">TEApot Meta Data
Specification</a></i> document.</p>

<dl class="definitions">
<dt><i class="term">Tcl Module</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Tcl Modules are for packages consisting of a single Tcl
file.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">Zip archive</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Zip archives are the catch-all for all other types of packages.
The important package index, i.e. "<b class=
"file">pkgIndex.tcl</b>", and the meta data have to be stored
without a path. In essence the archive represents a single
directory containing all the files of the package.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">Starkit</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Starkits are an extended form of Tcl Modules, a source-able Tcl
script at the beginning with a metakit filesystem attached at the
end. See <a href="http://tip.tcl.tk/190">TIP 190</a> for more
details on the use of starkits as Tcl modules. This format can be
used to hold a package, as an alternate to Zip archives, but we
expect the main use to be for applications.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">Starpack</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>Starpacks are one step further away from Tcl Modules, the
source-able header replaced by a binary executable capable of using
the attached metakit filesystem. This is the format for
platform-specific applications.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2><a name="section3">Meta data</a></h2>

<p>The meta data to be associated with packages and applications is
in a very free-form keyword/value based format, essentially an
encoding for a Tcl dictionary plus identification information
naming the entity in question.</p>

<p>The details of the format itself and how the data is stored in
the various forms of packages as described in the previous section
can be found in the <i class="term"><a href=
"CTP_metadata.html">TEApot Meta Data Specification</a></i>.</p>

<p>One thing of note is that the quite unlimited nature of the
format seems to go very much against the grain of making things
easier by limiting choice to the main/important options, as we so
strongly expounded at the beginning of this document.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this however. Packages in their various
forms have been a feature of Tcl which has existed for quite some
time, and by now we have gained an understanding of its space -
what the most important forms are.</p>

<p>Meta data for packages however is at the very beginning of its
life and it is not clear at this time which meta data is merely
wanted, possibly needed, or absolutely essential. Because of this
we are intentionally not limiting the imagination of users with
regard to keywords and their meaning, with the sole exception of
the keywords which are claimed by ActiveState's tools for their
use.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4" class="section">
<h2><a name="section4">Repositories</a></h2>

<p>TEApot repositories come in basically two forms, <i class=
"term"><a href="../../index.html#key23">opaque</a></i> and <i
class="term"><a href="../../index.html#key14">transparent</a></i>.
The latter expose their internal structure, i.e. filesystem
hierarchy, and make it accessible to the package management code of
a tclsh. An opaque repository on the other hand is not accessible
to a tclsh.</p>

<p>Because of that the term <i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key14">transparent</a></i> is basically
synonymous with the term <i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key21">installation</a></i> repository, a
repository from which packages are loaded for actual execution.</p>

<p>This implicit connection to a tclsh is another difference
between transparent/installation and opaque repositories. We can
store whatever package we like into an opaque repository, but a
transparent repository can hold only packages the connected tclsh
is actually able to execute. I.e. only packages with an
architecture matching the tclsh can be stored. To be able to know
this architecture the implicit connection is made explicit, by
telling installation repositories which shells are using them.</p>

<p>In summary, transparent repositories are designed for
interaction with Tcl installations, whereas opaque repositories are
more cast into the role of general, central archives servicing the
installations.</p>

<p>There is a second axis of classification for repositories. The
relevant terms for this axis are <i class="term">local</i> versus
<i class="term"><a href="../../index.html#key25">remote</a></i>, or
<i class="term"><a href="../../index.html#key42">filesystem</a></i>
versus <i class="term"><a href=
"../../index.html#key33">network</a></i>. A local repository is
accessible through the filesystem, while a remote repository is
accessible through the web, i.e. the network.</p>

<p>This makes for a total of four classes of repositories, one of
which is empty. We do not have <i class="term">remote
transparent</i> repositories.</p>

<dl class="definitions">
<dt><i class="term">local transparent</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>A user of ActiveTcl's tclsh uses this type of repository when
they invoke Tcl's package command. This is also where <b class=
"syscmd"><a href="CTP_teacup.html">teacup</a></b> installs
packages.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">local opaque</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>The Tcl Dev Kit comes with a helper repository containing a
number of profiles to translate bogus package names in older
project files to the correct names. It is opaque and in the
filesystem of the Tcl Dev Kit installation.</p>

<p>Other repositories which can fall under this heading could
be</p>

<ul class="itemized">
<li>
<p>Company-specific company-wide central repositories.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Developer-specific repositories for TclApp to draw upon.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">remote opaque</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>ActiveState's public repository of Tcl packages falls under this
heading. A company-specific company-wide central repository may
also fall under this, if it is made accessible over the web instead
of a company-wide filesystem.</p>

<p>Repositories of this kind can be accessed by <b class=
"syscmd"><a href="CTP_teacup.html">teacup</a></b>, as a source of
packages to install.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i class="term">remote transparent</i></dt>

<dd>
<p>It is possible to implement such a repository, by extending
Tcl's package management code to be able to load a package through
the network, however this has heavy implications for the security
of an installation, most likely weakening it, and reliability of
the network comes into play as well. We are not willing to deal
with that and have punted on this.</p>

<p>This is especially true as it is always possible to copy the
required packages into a local repository, giving the user much
better control of their environment.</p>
