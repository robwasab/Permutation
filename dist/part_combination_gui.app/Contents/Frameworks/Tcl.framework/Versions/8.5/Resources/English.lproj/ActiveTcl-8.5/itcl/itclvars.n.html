<h3>NAME</h3>

itclvars - variables used by [incrTcl] 

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The following global variables are created and managed
automatically by the <b>[incrTcl]</b> library. Except where noted
below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by
application-specific code and by users.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>itcl::library</b></dt>

<dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incrTcl]</b> initializes
this variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system
library of <b>[incrTcl]</b> scripts. The initial value of
<b>itcl::library</b> is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment
variable if it exists, or from a compiled-in value otherwise.</dd>

<dt><b>itcl::patchLevel</b></dt>

<dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incrTcl]</b> initializes
this variable to hold the current patch level for <b>[incrTcl]</b>.
For example, the value "<b>2.0p1</b>" indicates <b>[incrTcl]</b>
version 2.0 with the first set of patches applied.</dd>

<dt><b>itcl::purist</b></dt>

<dd>When an interpreter is created containing Tcl/Tk and the
<b>[incrTcl]</b> namespace facility, this variable controls a
"backward-compatibility" mode for widget access.<br>
In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the
access command for a widget is the same as the window name. When a
widget is created within a namespace, however, its access command
is installed in that namespace, and should be accessed outside of
the namespace using a qualified name. For example, 

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace foo {
    namespace bar {
        button .b -text "Testing"
    }
}
foo::bar::.b configure -background red
pack .b
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note that the window name ".b" is still used in conjunction with
commands like <b>pack</b> and <b>destroy</b>. However, the access
command for the widget (i.e., name that appears as the <i>first</i>
argument on a command line) must be more specific.<br>
The "<b>winfo command</b>" command can be used to query the
fully-qualified access command for any widget, so one can write: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
[winfo command .b] configure -background red
</pre>
</blockquote>

and this is good practice when writing library procedures. Also, in
conjunction with the <b>bind</b> command, the "%q" field can be
used in place of "%W" as the access command: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}
</pre>
</blockquote>

While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of
encapsulation, it causes problems with existing Tcl/Tk
applications. Many existing applications are written with bindings
that use "%W". Many library procedures assume that the window name
is the access command.<br>
The <b>itcl::purist</b> variable controls a backward-compatibility
mode. By default, this variable is "0", and the window name can be
used as an access command in any context. Whenever the
<b>unknown</b> procedure stumbles across a widget name, it simply
uses "<b>winfo command</b>" to determine the appropriate command
name. If this variable is set to "1", this backward-compatibility
mode is disabled. This gives better encapsulation, but using the
window name as the access command may lead to "invalid command"
errors.</dd>

<dt><b>itcl::version</b></dt>

<dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incrTcl]</b> initializes
this variable to hold the version number of the form <i>x.y</i>.
Changes to <i>x</i> represent major changes with probable
incompatibilities and changes to <i>y</i> represent small
enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility.</dd>
