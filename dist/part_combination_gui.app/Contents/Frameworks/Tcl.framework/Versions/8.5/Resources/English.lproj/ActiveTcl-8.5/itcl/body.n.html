<h3>NAME</h3>

body - change the body for a class method/proc 

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<b>itcl::body</b> <i>className</i><b>::</b><i>function args
body</i> 

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The <b>body</b> command is used outside of an <b>[incrTcl]</b>
class definition to define or redefine the body of a class method
or proc. This facility allows a class definition to have separate
"interface" and "implementation" parts. The "interface" part is a
<b><a href="class.n.html">class</a></b> command with declarations
for methods, procs, instance variables and common variables. The
"implementation" part is a series of <b>body</b> and <b><a href=
"configbody.n.html">configbody</a></b> commands. If the
"implementation" part is kept in a separate file, it can be sourced
again and again as bugs are fixed, to support interactive
development. When using the "tcl" mode in the <b>emacs</b> editor,
the "interface" and "implementation" parts can be kept in the same
file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted and
sent to the test application.</p>

<p>The name "<i>className</i><b>::</b><i>function</i>" identifies
the method/proc being changed.</p>

<p>If an <i>args</i> list was specified when the <i>function</i>
was defined in the class definition, the <i>args</i> list for the
<b>body</b> command must match in meaning. Variable names can
change, but the argument lists must have the same required
arguments and the same default values for optional arguments. The
special <b>args</b> argument acts as a wildcard when included in
the <i>args</i> list in the class definition; it will match zero or
more arguments of any type when the body is redefined.</p>

<p>If the <i>body</i> string starts with "<b>@</b>", it is treated
as the symbolic name for a C procedure. The <i>args</i> list has
little meaning for the C procedure, except to document the expected
usage. (The C procedure is not guaranteed to use arguments in this
manner.) If <i>body</i> does not start with "<b>@</b>", it is
treated as a Tcl command script. When the function is invoked,
command line arguments are matched against the <i>args</i> list,
and local variables are created to represent each argument. This is
the usual behavior for a Tcl-style proc.</p>

<p>Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering
procedures via <b>Itcl_RegisterC()</b>. This is usually done in the
<b>Tcl_AppInit()</b> procedure, which is automatically called when
the interpreter starts up. In the following example, the procedure
My_FooCmd() is registered with the symbolic name "foo". This
procedure can be referenced in the <b>body</b> command as
"@foo".</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
int
Tcl_AppInit(interp)
    Tcl_Interp *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }

    if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, "foo", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

In the following example, a "File" class is defined to represent
open files. The method bodies are included below the class
definition via the <b>body</b> command. Note that the bodies of the
constructor/destructor must be included in the class definition,
but they can be redefined via the <b>body</b> command as well. 

<blockquote>
<pre>
itcl::class File {
    private variable fid ""
    constructor {name access} {
        set fid [open $name $access]
    }
    destructor {
        close $fid
    }

    method get {}
    method put {line}
    method eof {}
}

itcl::body File::get {} {
    return [gets $fid]
}
itcl::body File::put {line} {
    puts $fid $line
}
itcl::body File::eof {} {
    return [::eof $fid]
}

#
# See the File class in action:
#
File x /etc/passwd "r"
while {![x eof]} {
    puts "=&gt; [x get]"
}
itcl::delete object x
</pre>
</blockquote>
