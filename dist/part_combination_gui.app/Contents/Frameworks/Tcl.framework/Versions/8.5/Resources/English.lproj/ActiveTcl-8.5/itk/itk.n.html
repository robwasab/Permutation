<h3>NAME</h3>

itk - framework for building mega-widgets in Tcl/Tk 

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using
Tk widgets as component parts, usually without any C code. A
fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry
widgets and some control buttons. These individual widgets are put
together in a way that makes them act like one big widget. A
fileselectionbox mega-widget can be created with a command
like:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white
</pre>
</blockquote>

Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command
like: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
.fsb configure -background green -foreground black
</pre>
</blockquote>

and all of its internal components will change color. Each
mega-widget has a set of methods that can be used to manipulate it.
For example, the current selection can be queried from a
fileselectionbox like this: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
set fileName [.fsb get]
</pre>
</blockquote>

In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget,
but is considerably easier to implement. 

<p><b>[incrTk]</b> is a framework for building mega-widgets. It
uses <b>[incrTcl]</b> to support the object paradigm, and adds base
classes which provide default widget behaviors.</p>

<p>All <b>[incrTk]</b> widgets are derived from the <b><a href=
"Archetype.n.html">Archetype</a></b> base class. This class manages
internal component widgets, and provides methods like "configure"
and "cget" to access configuration options.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="Widget.n.html">Widget</a></b> base class
inherits everything from <b><a href=
"Archetype.n.html">Archetype</a></b>, and adds a Tk frame which
acts as a container for the mega-widget. It is used to build
mega-widgets that sit inside of other frames and toplevels. Derived
classes create other internal components and pack them into the
"hull" frame created by the <b><a href=
"Widget.n.html">Widget</a></b> base class.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="Toplevel.n.html">Toplevel</a></b> base class
inherits everything from <b><a href=
"Archetype.n.html">Archetype</a></b>, but adds a Tk toplevel which
acts as a container for the mega-widget. It is used to build
mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that have their own toplevel
window. Derived classes create other internal components and pack
them into the "hull" toplevel created by the <b><a href=
"Toplevel.n.html">Toplevel</a></b> base class.</p>

<h3>[incr Widgets] LIBRARY</h3>

<p><b>[incrWidgets]</b> is a mega-widget library built using
<b>[incrTk]</b>. It can be used right out of the box, and contains
more than 30 different widget classes, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>fileselectiondialog</li>

<li>tabnotebook</li>

<li>panedwindow</li>

<li>combobox</li>

<li>optionmenu</li>

<li>scrolledlistbox</li>

<li>scrolledframe</li>

<li>messagedialog</li>

<li>and many others...</li>
</ol>

<p>The <b>catalog</b> demo in the "iwidgets/demos" directory shows
all of the available widgets in action. Each widget class has its
own man page describing the features available.</p>
