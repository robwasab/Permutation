<h3><a name="M2">NAME</a></h3>

tk_focusNext, tk_focusPrev, tk_focusFollowsMouse - Utility
procedures for managing the input focus. 

<h3><a name="M3">SYNOPSIS</a></h3>

<b>tk_focusNext</b> <i>window</i><br>
<b>tk_focusPrev</b> <i>window</i><br>
<b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b><br>
<h3><a name="M4">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

<b>tk_focusNext</b> is a utility procedure used for keyboard
traversal. It returns the &ldquo;next&rdquo; window after
<i>window</i> in focus order. The focus order is determined by the
stacking order of windows and the structure of the window
hierarchy. Among siblings, the focus order is the same as the
stacking order, with the lowest window being first. If a window has
children, the window is visited first, followed by its children
(recursively), followed by its next sibling. Top-level windows
other than <i>window</i> are skipped, so that <b>tk_focusNext</b>
never returns a window in a different top-level from <i>window</i>.


<p>After computing the next window, <b>tk_focusNext</b> examines
the window's <b>-takefocus</b> option to see whether it should be
skipped. If so, <b>tk_focusNext</b> continues on to the next window
in the focus order, until it eventually finds a window that will
accept the focus or returns back to <i>window</i>.</p>

<p><b>tk_focusPrev</b> is similar to <b>tk_focusNext</b> except
that it returns the window just before <i>window</i> in the focus
order.</p>

<p><b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> changes the focus model for the
application to an implicit one where the window under the mouse
gets the focus. After this procedure is called, whenever the mouse
enters a window Tk will automatically give it the input focus. The
<b><a href="../TkCmd/focus.htm">focus</a></b> command may be used
to move the focus to a window other than the one under the mouse,
but as soon as the mouse moves into a new window the focus will
jump to that window. Note: at present there is no built-in support
for returning the application to an explicit focus model; to do
this you will have to write a script that deletes the bindings
created by <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b>.</p>
