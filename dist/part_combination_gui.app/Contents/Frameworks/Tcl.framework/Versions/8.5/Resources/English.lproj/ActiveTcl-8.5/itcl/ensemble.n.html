<h3>NAME</h3>

ensemble - create or modify a composite command 

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<b>itcl::ensemble</b> <i>ensName</i> ?<i>command arg arg...</i>?
<br>
or <br>
<b>ensemble</b> <i>ensName</i> { <br>
 <b>part</b> <i>partName args body</i> <br>
 <i>...</i> <br>
 <b>ensemble</b> <i>partName</i> { <br>
 <b>part</b> <i>subPartName args body</i> <br>
 <b>part</b> <i>subPartName args body</i> <br>
 <i>...</i> } <br>
} 

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The <b>ensemble</b> command is used to create or modify a
composite command. See the section <b>WHAT IS AN ENSEMBLE?</b>
below for a brief overview of ensembles.</p>

<p>If the <b>ensemble</b> command finds an existing ensemble called
<i>ensName</i>, it updates that ensemble. Otherwise, it creates an
ensemble called <i>ensName</i>. If the <i>ensName</i> is a simple
name like "foo", then an ensemble command named "foo" is added to
the current namespace context. If a command named "foo" already
exists in that context, then it is deleted. If the <i>ensName</i>
contains namespace qualifiers like "a::b::foo", then the namespace
path is resolved, and the ensemble command is added that namespace
context. Parent namespaces like "a" and "b" are created
automatically, as needed.</p>

<p>If the <i>ensName</i> contains spaces like "a::b::foo bar baz",
then additional words like "bar" and "baz" are treated as
sub-ensembles. Sub-ensembles are merely parts within an ensemble;
they do not have a Tcl command associated with them. An ensemble
like "foo" can have a sub-ensemble called "foo bar", which in turn
can have a sub-ensemble called "foo bar baz". In this case, the
sub-ensemble "foo bar" must be created before the sub-ensemble "foo
bar baz" that resides within it.</p>

<p>If there are any arguments following <i>ensName</i>, then they
are treated as commands, and they are executed to update the
ensemble. The following commands are recognized in this context:
<b>part</b> and <b>ensemble</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>part</b> command defines a new part for the ensemble. Its
syntax is identical to the usual <b>proc</b> command, but it
defines a part within an ensemble, instead of a Tcl command. If a
part called <i>partName</i> already exists within the ensemble,
then the <b>part</b> command returns an error.</p>

<p>The <b>ensemble</b> command can be nested inside another
<b>ensemble</b> command to define a sub-ensemble.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS AN ENSEMBLE?</h3>

The usual "info" command is a composite command--the command name
<b>info</b> must be followed by a sub-command like <b><a href=
"body.n.html">body</a></b> or <b>globals</b>. We will refer to a
command like <b>info</b> as an <i>ensemble</i>, and to sub-commands
like <b><a href="body.n.html">body</a></b> or <b>globals</b> as its
<i>parts</i>. 

<p>Ensembles can be nested. For example, the <b>info</b> command
has an ensemble <b>info namespace</b> within it. This ensemble has
parts like <b>info namespace all</b> and <b>info namespace
children</b>.</p>

<p>With ensembles, composite commands can be created and extended
in an automatic way. Any package can find an existing ensemble and
add new parts to it. So extension writers can add their own parts,
for example, to the <b>info</b> command.</p>

<p>The ensemble facility manages all of the part names and keeps
track of unique abbreviations. Normally, you can abbreviate <b>info
complete</b> to <b>info comp</b>. But if an extension adds the part
<b>info complexity</b>, the minimum abbreviation for <b>info
complete</b> becomes <b>info complet</b>.</p>

<p>The ensemble facility not only automates the construction of
composite commands, but it automates the error handling as well. If
you invoke an ensemble command without specifying a part name, you
get an automatically generated error message that summarizes the
usage information. For example, when the <b>info</b> command is
invoked without any arguments, it produces the following error
message:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
wrong # args: should be one of...
  info args procname
  info body procname
  info cmdcount
  info commands ?pattern?
  info complete command
  info context
  info default procname arg varname
  info exists varName
  info globals ?pattern?
  info level ?number?
  info library
  info locals ?pattern?
  info namespace option ?arg arg ...?
  info patchlevel
  info procs ?pattern?
  info protection ?-command? ?-variable? name
  info script
  info tclversion
  info vars ?pattern?
  info which ?-command? ?-variable? ?-namespace? name
</pre>
</blockquote>

You can also customize the way an ensemble responds to errors. When
an ensemble encounters an unspecified or ambiguous part name, it
looks for a part called <b>@error</b>. If it exists, then it is
used to handle the error. This part will receive all of the
arguments on the command line starting with the offending part
name. It can find another way of resolving the command, or generate
its own error message. 

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

We could use an ensemble to clean up the syntax of the various
"wait" commands in Tcl/Tk. Instead of using a series of strange
commands like this: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
vwait x
tkwait visibility .top
tkwait window .
</pre>
</blockquote>

we could use commands with a uniform syntax, like this: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
wait variable x
wait visibility .top
wait window .
</pre>
</blockquote>

The Tcl package could define the following ensemble: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
itcl::ensemble wait part variable {name} {
    uplevel vwait $name
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The Tk package could add some options to this ensemble, with a
command like this: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
itcl::ensemble wait {
    part visibility {name} {
        tkwait visibility $name
    }
    part window {name} {
        tkwait window $name
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Other extensions could add their own parts to the <b>wait</b>
command too.
