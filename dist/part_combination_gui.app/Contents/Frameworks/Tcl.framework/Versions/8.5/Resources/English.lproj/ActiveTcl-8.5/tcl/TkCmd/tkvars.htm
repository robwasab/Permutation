tkvars - Variables used or set by Tk 

<h3><a name="M3">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

The following Tcl variables are either set or used by Tk at various
times in its execution: 

<dl class="description">
<dt><a name="M4"><b>tk_library</b></a></dt>

<dd>This variable holds the file name for a directory containing a
library of Tcl scripts related to Tk. These scripts include an
initialization file that is normally processed whenever a Tk
application starts up, plus other files containing procedures that
implement default behaviors for widgets. The initial value of
<b>tcl_library</b> is set when Tk is added to an interpreter; this
is done by searching several different directories until one is
found that contains an appropriate Tk startup script. If the
<b>TK_LIBRARY</b> environment variable exists, then the directory
it names is checked first. If <b>TK_LIBRARY</b> is not set or does
not refer to an appropriate directory, then Tk checks several other
directories based on a compiled-in default location, the location
of the Tcl library directory, the location of the binary containing
the application, and the current working directory. The variable
can be modified by an application to switch to a different
library.</dd>

<dt><a name="M5"><b>tk_patchLevel</b></a></dt>

<dd>Contains a decimal integer giving the current patch level for
Tk. The patch level is incremented for each new release or patch,
and it uniquely identifies an official version of Tk.</dd>

<dt><a name="M6"><b>tk::Priv</b></a></dt>

<dd>This variable is an array containing several pieces of
information that are private to Tk. The elements of <b>tk::Priv</b>
are used by Tk library procedures and default bindings. They should
not be accessed by any code outside Tk.</dd>

<dt><a name="M7"><b>tk_strictMotif</b></a></dt>

<dd>This variable is set to zero by default. If an application sets
it to one, then Tk attempts to adhere as closely as possible to
Motif look-and-feel standards. For example, active elements such as
buttons and scrollbar sliders will not change color when the
pointer passes over them.</dd>

<dt><a name="M8"><b>tk_textRedraw</b></a></dt>

<dt><a name="M9"><b>tk_textRelayout</b></a></dt>

<dd>These variables are set by text widgets when they have
debugging turned on. The values written to these variables can be
used to test or debug text widget operations. These variables are
mostly used by Tk's test suite.</dd>

<dt><a name="M10"><b>tk_version</b></a></dt>

<dd>Tk sets this variable in the interpreter for each application.
The variable holds the current version number of the Tk library in
the form <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>. <i>Major</i> and <i>minor</i>
are integers. The major version number increases in any Tk release
that includes changes that are not backward compatible (i.e.
whenever existing Tk applications and scripts may have to change to
work with the new release). The minor version number increases with
each new release of Tk, except that it resets to zero whenever the
major version number changes.</dd>
